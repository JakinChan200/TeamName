printf vs cout
    printf and cout are seperate, but printf is faster because it is lower level and doesn't do error checking. 
    Synchronization between the two makes it slow as well, but "std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);" turns it off, making cout faster. Do not use if you mix cout with other stuff
